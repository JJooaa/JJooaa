# I'm Joa and I like to code React 👋 💙

- 📅 Started coding late 2019 with Python (learned the syntax, didn't like it)
- ➡️ In Summer 2020 I decided to try Web Development and started to learn (Html, Css, Javascript, React) at [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
- ➡️ In January 2021 I started at Digitalents Academy as a intern where I developed my Front end development skills (6 months)
- ➡️ Currently I work at Digitalents Academy as an assistant teacher. I guess I was a good dude which resulted in a job offer after I had finished my intership.

Im big on self development. I try to be better everyday. I try to understand my mind more and more everyday.
A good quote from Tony Robbins:

> "I believe life is constantly testing us for our level of commitment, and life's greatest rewards are reserved for those who demonstrate a never-ending commitment to act until they achieve. This level of resolve can move mountains, but it must be constant and consistent."
